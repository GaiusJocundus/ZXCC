# ZXCC

## Introduction

This is John Eliott's CP/M 2/3 emulator for cross-compiling and
running CP/M tools under MS-DOS and Linux/Unix/macOS.

This repository has been initially extracted from John Elliott's
Stable version 0.5.7 source-code at

http://www.seasip.info/Unix/Zxcc/zxcc-0.5.7.tar.gz

I have some updates that will be applied soon to remedy some
issues that I found when using the latest version of the
HI-TECH Z80 C compiler v3.09-x - obtainable from the repository
at

https://github.com/agn453/HI-TECH-Z80-C

I welcome bug reports/fixes and additional commentry and discussion.

You can raise an issue here on GitHub or contact me directly via e-mail
at <agn453@gmail.com>.
